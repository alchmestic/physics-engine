A physics engine is a software library that allows for the simulation of physical systems, such as those found in video games or scientific simulations.
A physics engine uses mathematical models to simulate the behavior of objects under various physical forces such as gravity, friction, and collisions.
Popular physics engines include Box2D, PhysX, Havok, Bullet Physics, and ODE. These engines are used in a variety of applications, including video games, virtual reality, robotics, and scientific simulations.
In computer video games, physics engines enhance the player's enjoyment by simulating the complex physical characteristics of a virtual world. Unlike scientific physics engines, video games engines use an approximation of real-world physics to quickly simulate complex world interactions, in real-time, computed on the computer's GPU.
